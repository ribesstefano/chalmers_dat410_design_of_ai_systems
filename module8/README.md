# Mini-Project

* Data cleaning and requirements description: 4 hours, many examples are already available online and the datasets themselves aren't particularly large to manage.
* Models Design: 8 hours, at least two models shall be designed (CNN+RNN-based and Transformer architectures).
* Models Development: 20 hours, this phase shall include the training and hyper parameters tuning of the designed models.
* Evaluation: 2 hours, different tests shall be carried out and properly reported.


## Tasks

* Stefano
	* Evaluation:
		* time evaluation
		* scalability
		* accuracy

* Daniele
	* Collect Python models: GRU, CNN+RNN? Transformer? check [this project](https://github.com/gyunggyung/Sequence-Models-coursera/tree/master/Week%203/Trigger%20word%20detection).
	* Implement and train them on fake datasets:
	* get the shape of the data required
	* Get the parameters
